# Project Constitution – Evolution of Todo

## Core Principle
All application code must be generated by Claude using written specifications.
No human-written application code is allowed.

## Development Method
- Spec-driven development is mandatory
- Each feature requires a written Markdown specification
- Specs are refined until correct output is generated

## Phase I Constraints
- Language: Python
- Runtime: Console application
- Storage: In-memory only
- Libraries: Python standard library only

## Code Quality Rules
- Code must be modular and readable
- Functions must be small and single-purpose
- Clear separation of concerns

## Prohibited Actions
- Manual editing of generated code
- Adding features without specs
- Using external packages
