# Evolution of Todo - Project Constitution

## Project Background

The "Evolution of Todo" is a hackathon project that follows a 5-phase progressive development journey. Starting with a simple in-memory Python console application, the project evolves through increasingly sophisticated implementations culminating in a cloud-native AI-powered deployment solution.

## Purpose and Scope

This Constitution serves as the foundational governance document for the "Evolution of Todo" project. It establishes mandatory development principles, constraints, and quality standards that apply to all project phases. All human and AI contributors must adhere to these rules throughout the project lifecycle.

## Governing Principles

### 1. Spec-Driven Development (SDD) Mandate
- **Mandatory Specification**: Every feature, function, and capability must be defined in a written specification before implementation
- **Specification Precedence**: All specifications must be finalized and approved before code generation begins
- **Traceability Requirement**: Every line of code must be traceable to a specific requirement in the corresponding specification
- **Implementation Fidelity**: Code generation must strictly adhere to the written specifications without deviation

### 2. Prohibition of Manual Code Modifications
- **No Manual Editing**: Manual editing of feature code is strictly prohibited
- **AI-Generated Code Only**: All feature code must be generated by Claude Code or other approved AI assistants
- **Specification-Based Changes**: Code modifications require specification updates first, followed by regeneration
- **Exception Handling**: Only non-functional elements (documentation, comments, configuration files) may be manually edited

## Phase-Specific Constraints

### Phase I: Python Console Application
- **Language Constraint**: Python only
- **Library Restriction**: Standard library exclusively (no external packages)
- **Interface Limitation**: Console/text-based interaction only
- **Architecture**: In-memory data storage only (no persistence)
- **Dependencies**: Zero external dependencies permitted
- **Functionality**: Core CRUD operations for todo items only

### Future Phases (II-V): Progressive Enhancement Rules
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with previous phase functionality
- **Incremental Addition**: New features layered without breaking existing functionality
- **Documentation**: Updated specifications for each phase
- **Constraint Evolution**: New constraints may be added but existing ones remain

## Code Quality Standards

### Modularity Requirements
- **Function Size**: Maximum 50 lines per function
- **File Size**: Maximum 500 lines per file
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module performs one primary function
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined public APIs with encapsulated internals
- **Dependency Management**: Minimal coupling between modules

### Readability and Maintainability
- **Documentation**: Every public function and class must have comprehensive docstrings
- **Naming Conventions**: Descriptive, consistent naming aligned with language idioms
- **Code Comments**: Explanatory comments for complex logic only
- **Consistent Formatting**: Adherence to language-specific style guides

### Separation of Concerns
- **Business Logic**: Isolated from presentation and data access layers
- **Data Management**: Separate from business logic and user interface
- **User Interface**: Independent of business logic (where applicable)
- **Configuration**: Externalized and separate from code

## Prohibited Actions

### Absolute Prohibitions
- Manual editing of feature code for functional requirements
- Installation or use of external libraries during Phase I
- Deviation from written specifications without prior update
- Hardcoding values not defined in specifications
- Introduction of circular dependencies
- Violation of modularity constraints
- Skipping specification for any feature implementation

### Process Violations
- Generating code without a corresponding specification
- Implementing features not documented in specifications
- Bypassing quality assurance procedures
- Ignoring architectural constraints
- Compromising security or performance requirements

## Acceptance Criteria

### Specification Quality
- All requirements clearly articulated and measurable
- Test scenarios defined for each feature
- Edge cases and error conditions documented
- Performance and scalability requirements specified

### Implementation Quality
- Code passes all defined test cases
- Meets performance benchmarks specified in requirements
- Maintains modularity and separation of concerns
- Complies with all phase-specific constraints

### Compliance Verification
- Automated checks confirm adherence to constraints
- Specification-to-code traceability verified
- Quality metrics meet defined thresholds
- All prohibited actions avoided

## Governance and Authority

### Constitution Authority
- This Constitution supersedes all other project documents
- No AI system, human contributor, or external authority may override constitutional provisions
- All development activities must comply with constitutional requirements
- Changes to this Constitution require explicit constitutional amendment process

### Amendment Process
- Constitutional amendments require explicit justification and approval
- Amendment process must maintain or strengthen existing constraints
- All amendments logged with timestamp and rationale
- Retroactive application only for strengthening project integrity

### Compliance Monitoring
- Regular audits verify constitutional adherence
- Automated tools monitor constraint compliance
- Metrics collected on specification completeness
- Reports generated showing constitutional compliance status

## Role in Future Phases

This Constitution remains the governing document for all subsequent phases of the "Evolution of Todo" project. Each phase must comply with constitutional requirements while adding phase-specific constraints. The principles of Spec-Driven Development, prohibition of manual code edits, and quality standards apply to all project phases regardless of technology stack or deployment environment.

## Enforcement

### Violation Response
- **Minor Violations**: Immediate code rollback and specification update
- **Major Violations**: Full audit of affected codebase and process review
- **Repeated Violations**: Suspension of contribution privileges until remediation
- **Severe Violations**: Requirement to restart implementation from last compliant state

### Verification Mechanisms
- Pre-commit hooks verify specification compliance
- Automated checks enforce phase-specific constraints
- Code review gates ensure constitutional adherence
- Build failures triggered by constitutional violations

*This Constitution is effective immediately and applies to all project phases. No AI system, algorithm, or human contributor may override these provisions. All development activities must align with these constitutional requirements.*
